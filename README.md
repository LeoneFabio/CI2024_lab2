## Notation and Acronyms

- **TSP**: Traveling Salesman Problem
- **Tour** and **Path**: Synonymous terms referring to the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin.
- **Total Length** or **Total Distance**: The cumulative length (in kilometers) of the entire tour.
- **Num Steps**: Number of cities visited in the tour.
- **MST**: Minimum Spanning Tree
- **NNA**: Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
- **GA**: Genetic Algorithm

## Contents

Tours are computed for the countries Russia, Italy, Vanuatu, China, and the USA, with city data provided in the respective `.csv` files located in the `cities` folder.

This project presents both **Greedy** and **Genetic** approaches. It includes three greedy algorithms (two well-known in computer science literature and one based on a custom idea) and a flexible Genetic Algorithm that supports various strategies for parent selection, crossover, and mutation. 

### Greedy Implementations

- **MST-Based Approach**: Uses a Depth First Search (DFS) starting from a graph of all connected cities.
- **Custom NNA**: An innovative approach that alternately selects the closest city from both the start and end of the tour toward the middle. This method leverages the idea that since the starting and ending city are the same, building the tour from both ends toward the middle may lead to a more optimized loop than advancing linearly.
- **Classic NNA**: Constructs the tour by selecting the closest city as the next destination.

### Genetic Algorithm Implementation

The Genetic Algorithm (GA) includes the following strategies for each of its main components:

- **Parent Selection**:
    - Uniform Selection
    - Roulette Wheel Selection
    - Fitness-Proportional Selection
    - Rank-Based Selection
    - Tournament Selection
- **Crossover**:
    - Order Crossover
    - Partially Mapped Crossover
    - Cycle Crossover
    - Inver-Over Crossover
- **Mutation**:
    - Scramble Mutation
    - Insert Mutation
    - Inversion Mutation

Additionally, plots are provided to illustrate how the total distance evolves over generations (iterations) in the genetic algorithm.

## Observations

- Greedy solutions are fast but approximate.
- To enhance the Genetic Algorithm's starting population, paths generated by the three greedy algorithms were included, providing high-quality reference points.
- For the **Traveling Salesman Problem**, the best GA configuration observed was tournament selection, combined with order crossover (OX) and inversion mutation.
- Fitness in the GA is defined as the inverse of the total distance. Note that using `-total_distance` directly is incompatible with roulette wheel selection due to negative values.
- In general, the GA is slower than greedy algorithms but produces a more accurate solution, approaching a high-quality suboptimal solution.
